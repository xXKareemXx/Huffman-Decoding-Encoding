# Huffman Enoding/Decoding Program
This Python program implements the Huffman encoding and decoding algorithm, a popular technique for lossless data compression. Huffman coding is widely used in file compression, especially in scenarios where efficient representation of frequently occurring symbols is crucial. The program allows users to encode a message using Huffman coding and decode it back to its original form.

## Features
1. **Huffman Encoding:** <br>
Compress a message by encoding it using Huffman coding.
2. **Huffman Decoding:** <br>
Decompress a Huffman-encoded message to its original form.
3. **Customizable Input:** <br>
Accept any alphanumeric input for encoding and decoding.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository:**<br>
'''bash git clone https://github.com/yourusername/huffman-coding.git cd huffman-coding
